#' Creates a constraint equation based on the input data frame.
#' 
#' @param x data frame containing needed input data
#' @param weight.var character name of the column of the input weights
#' @param match.var character vector of names of columns of 'data' we wish to 
#'   match on
#' @param replace logical indicating whether or not bservations weighted in the 
#'   original weight.var are allowed positive weight in the output.
#'   
#' @return A list with two named components: A and b, representing the
#'   components of the constraint equation \eqn{Ax = b}

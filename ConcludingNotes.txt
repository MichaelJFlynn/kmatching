Concluding Notes:
Depressing final result: achr - "adaptive centering hit and run" I hoped
would solve all our problems, it didn't, even though it got rid of the matrix multiplication
step that was taking so much time and apparently mathematically converges faster, I could not
get samples that were as different from each other within a chain as they were between chains.
A simple example:
set.seed(21)
data(lalonde)
matchvars = c("age", "educ", "black")
k = kmatch(lalonde, weight.var = "treat", match.var = matchvars, n = 1000, skiplength = 500*30, analyse = TRUE, chains=4, achr = TRUE)

Compare the difference of these two:
plot(k[[1]][,1])
plot(k[[1]][,1000])
This is comparing two different samples in 1 chain (chain 1) (y is weight, x is index, each plot is one "portfolio")

Now compare that difference to this difference:
plot(k[[1]][,1])
plot(k[[2]][,1])
This is the difference between the first sample of Chain 1 and the first sample of Chain 2.

It is clear from these plots that there are much more differences in the samples between chains than
within them. And this is even with a skiplength high enough that multiplying it by 100 to increase the
differnces of samples within the chain would make the running time way too high.

What this indicates to
me is that "mirror" combined with a psuedo-inverse generated initial point samples the space
much more completely than hitandrun. Perhaps the best way to sample points is to generate a bunch
of "initial points" in parallel and combine them together. Again this is a disappointing result for
me because hitandrun should be a quick and efficient algorithm. The main problem is for when
individual "stocks" or "weights" have large solution spaces, the algorithm does not explore these
spaces very well because no matter what direction is moved in, chances are it will set one of the
very small weights to zero before any significant distance is traveled. Another potential solution is 
to pick directions biased towards these large solution spaces. That would be possible via projecting a unit vector pointing in these directions onto the solution plane.
